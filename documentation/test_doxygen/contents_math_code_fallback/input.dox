/** @mainpage

Here's a block formula:

@f[
    \hat q = [\boldsymbol 0, 1] + \epsilon [\frac{\boldsymbol v}{2}, 0]
@f]

And @f$ \hat q @f$ is how quaternion is denoted. A green formula should have
the CSS class applied:

@m_class{m-success}

@f[
    \pi^2
@f]

A yellow @m_class{m-warning} @f$ \Sigma @f$ inline formula as well.
